			<h3>Crowdsourced vs Automated Social Media Privacy Suggestions</h3>
      <p>This project explores simple question: Do people prefer automated privacy suggestions on social media? Or do they prefer crowdsourced suggestions from other users?</p>

    <div class="text">
      <p>To answer this, I created a social media platform prototype and ran an experiment comparing the two scenarios. Results showed that <em>people were more receptive of the crowdsourced suggestions, but felt more in control when given automated ones</em>.</p>

			<h3>Natural Language Analysis: What Is r/privacy Talking About Adolescents?</h3>
      <p>The r/privacy Reddit community is where people go to discuss privacy things. But just like any special interest communities, users who gather around these communities aren't average people—most of them are <strong>very</strong> passionate about protecting their privacy.</p>
      <p>Since part of my interest is understanding privacy issues are impacting young people, I wrote a few Python scripts to analyze what the community was saying about them.</p>

      <p>In short: <em>Concerns about how major tech companies impact teen privacy have remained consistent over time, with growing attention to corporate surveillance and data practices. Since 2017, data-related topics have become more prominent.</em> During the COVID-19 pandemic, privacy conversations shifted more toward student surveillance and data collection in schools.</p>

			<h3>Privacy Factors and Willingness to Adopt ChatGPT</h3>
      <p>With the popularity of generative AI tools on the rise, so are the privacy concerns surrounding commercial products like ChatGPT. My lab mate and I became interested in this phenomenon, so we ran a pilot survey study.</p>

      <p>The verdict: People who with a greater understanding and higher sense of control over their privacy have a stronger privacy attitude… Therefore, <em>for people who have better knowledge and heightened sense of privacy, they may be more willing to adopt novel technologies like ChatGPT</em>.</p>
      <p>Why? Because they may feel more aware and are still in control.</p>
