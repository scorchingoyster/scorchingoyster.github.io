      <p>Librarians often work with limited resources, yet they're increasingly expected to manage complex privacy challenges as young patrons bring more advanced personal technologies into library spaces.</p> 
      <p>This led us to ask: <strong>How can we design resources to help librarians manage privacy issues involving young library users?</strong></p>

      <p>We conducted 12 design workshops with 100 librarians across different locations, aiming to produce a toolkit that fulfills the following goals:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify practical pain points and design a toolkit that help librarians make effective decisions impact</li>
        <li>Reduce librarians' job strain while serving young users and improve library's operational efficiency</li>
        <li>Strengthen the library's public presence and reinforced its role as a valuable community resource</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Here is what we found:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Librarians need to balance the needs of young library users with the expectations of the community and their institution, which can create complex challenges</li>
        <li>Young library users often view privacy differently from adults and may have different expectations about what librarians should do and how library rules apply to them</li>
        <li>As more data and technological resources become involved, it becomes harder for librarians to address youth privacy issues in clear and consistent ways</li>
      </ul>
      <p>What did we learn? <em>Librarians need different recommendations based on different contexts, and any decision-making tool needs to account for this.</em></p>
