      <p>There are lots of talks about how social media can harm young people's privacy, but instead we ask...</p> 
      <p><strong>How can online platforms and features better support teen users seeking social and privacy guidance?</strong></p>

      <p>I automated data collection from two platforms and thematically coded teen users' conversations, aiming to identify patterns in how they use asynchronous vs synchronous platforms for supportive interactions.</p>

      <p>Here are the key findings:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Teen users can learn about privacy through conversationsâ€”whether by discussing laws, debating issues, or sharing personal experiences</li>
        <li>The differences in the platform characteristics and feature designs shape teens' interaction and sharing behaviors</li>
      </ul>
      <p>What's the takeaway? Platforms should provide features support teen users in finding and checking information in real-time, as well as features that help users make sense of complex and nested conversations.</p>
