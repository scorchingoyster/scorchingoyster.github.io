			<h1>My First Ever UX Role</h1>

			<p>In the summer of 2013, I interned with the application UX team at Tyler Technologies to research and design for a mobile app concept, Munis Delivery. Over the span of ten weeks, I brought the concept from a brief paragraph of description to a completed interactive prototype.</p>

				<span>RESEARCH</span>
				Contextual Inquiry with On-site Workers
			</h2>
			<p>Minus Delivery was conceptualized to be an on-the-road companion app to the warehouse management software &mdash; to aid warehouse staff of public institutions in their delivery tasks.</p>

			<p>The exact needs that the app should fulfill, however, were not clear from the beginning; this was an entirely new scenario that the team hadn't tackled before, as most of the work was done on the in-house platforms, such as desktop and web apps.</p>

			<p>To bridge this lack of understanding, we arranged five interviews with different delivery staff from a number of customer sites. This process led to an abundance of notes and insights that we organized into key categories during a series of workshop.</p>

			<p>A few interesting insights from this stage:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The delivery <em>team size and effort invested were varied across the board</em>. Some were as small as one-person team and some others had a fleet of dedicated drivers.</li>

				<li>Despite the differences in headcount and logistics, the <em>delivery process remains largely consistent and the key tasks completed are similar</em>.</li>

				<li>Everyone wished or hinted at <em>wanting to complete some of the tasks they do on the PC software when they are away from the office</em>.</li>

				From Whiteboard Sketching to Prototyping

			<p>After the initial interviews, we followed up with further questions and clarified doubts with our users. We then distilled the key tasks into a userflow that captures the essential aspects of a delivery process.</p>

			<p>Later on, I created a low-fidelity interactive prototype in Axure and we invited three of the interviewees to return for a remote usability test. The selected participants were all provided with a context and three tasks to complete, and then we followed up with a Q&A segment at the end.</p>

			<h2>
				<span>AFTERWORD</span>
				A Brief Reflection
			</h2>
			<p>Since this was an end-to-end UX internship, the bulk of the time was spent on the upfront research, analysis, and ideation; there was barely enough time to wrap up the first draft of Axure prototype design at the end.</p>
			<p>In other words, there was still much work left to be done before this companion product was market-ready. For instance: As the prototype was operated on a PC and the drivers were sitting in front of a desk, the assessment only tested for the basic viability of the concept. Testing with real data during an actual delivery would be essential in this regard.</p>
			<p>Retrospectively, if I had more time, I would also consider conducting a thorough study in the workers' office to see a full picture of the warehouse operations. An ideal design can only be achieved by understanding the connection between the in-house and delivery workflows &mdash; otherwise I would run the risk of producing an incoherent product and actually undermine my own work.</p>
