			<h1>Designing for an Audience in Security</h1>

			<p>For a while, I served as the sole designer for the application security startup. nVisium. I led all the design efforts for the company &mdash; ranging from web front-end development, branding, to media editing and production.</p>

			<p>(And this is also where I discovered my passion in privacy &amp; security.)</p>

				Iterating on the Company Website
			</h2>
			<p>Working with our Director of Engineering, I designed and developed the front-end portion of the company's website, moving it from the generic Bootstrap 3 template and into my custom layouts. This spanned across two major iterations and many minor feature additions over time.</p>
			<p>By introducing a new set of mobile-friendly layouts and information architecture, <em>I managed to improve the loading speed by four folds</em>.</p>

				Branding and Visuals
			</h2>
			<p>To help market the company's brand, I created a mascot that's used across various digital and print materials &mdash; whether it's a victorious pose on a t-shirt that's given out to attendees of our expert training, or a troubled look when website visitors stumbled upon a missing page.</p>

			<p>Without further ado, I'd like to introduce you to nVisbot.</p>

			<p>My security colleagues also conduct research on industry trends as a part of their work. If there are interesting data points or findings, I try to capture them in the form of an infographic or visualization, so to add some more flavor to the report blog post or demo video.</p>
			<p>It's all about adding some fun for the folks in the field and making serious topics more digestible for the average audience.</p>
