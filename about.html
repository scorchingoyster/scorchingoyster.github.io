		<p>Hello, this is Hong! Welcome to my humble internet abode.</p>

		<p>You can reach me via my email, contact [at] hongyidong [dot] com. <br> (My CV and questionable life advice are available upon request.)</p>

	<p>Some fun facts about me and this site:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Yes, that's the Washington Monument in the picture. (I really love that scene in Forrest Gump.)</li>
		<li>The site logo is based on <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%AE%8F" target="_blank">the middle character</a> of my name.</li>
		<li>I handbuilt this website using plain HTML5 and generated the pages via Jekyll. You can see the source on my GitHub repo. (This site is gonna stay as a work-in-progress project.)</li>
		<li>I "know" a few languages. In sequence of proficiency: English, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, and Tagalog. I would probaby become a casual linguist if I never had to work for a living.</li>
		<li>Part of the reason why I know some of those languages is because I'm a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid" target="_blank">third culture kid</a>. I have also been living in a different continent from the rest of my family since I was 16.</li>
		<li>My favorite song of all time is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0KR6sDycuU" target="_blank">"RTB" by Monsieur Kayamatsu</a>.</li>
		<li>I like seeing new places and meeting people, but I'm not much of a traveler. Maybe it's because my family has moved around too much when I was a kid?</li>
		<li>In an alternate timeline, I'm probably a privacy advocate and a security researcher. I'm merely a hobbyist in this one.</li>
		<li>And that's why this site doesn't have any tracking mechanisms! Rejoice!</li>
