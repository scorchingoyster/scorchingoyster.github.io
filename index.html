      <h1>Hello, this is Hong <s>Kong</s>.</h1>
      <p>I'm pursuing my Ph.D. at the <a href="https://ist.psu.edu/" target="_blank">Informatics Program of Penn State University</a>, working with <a href="https://priyakumar.org/" target="_blank">Dr. Priya Kumar</a> in the Living Privacy Research Group.</p>
      <p>As a researcher, I am in the intersections of privacy, learning, and human-computer interaction &mdash; though I often find myself peeking into other disciplines as well. The world is just too fascinating.</p>
      <p>Need to get in touch? Feel free to email <strong>hongyi.dong [at] psu [dot] edu</strong>. <br> <small>(My questionable life advice is also available upon request.)</small></p>
