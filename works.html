    <h1>Not Just a Designer</h1>
    <p>I am a designer by training, but I aspire to not be bounded by this identity. <br>I am a problem solver above anything else.</p>
    <p>No matter how this world changes, there will always be human problems. And I am here to help us solve them &mdash; one step at a time.</p>
