				<span>BACKGROUND</span>
				The Great Migration
			</h2>

			<p>Up until 2019, both the academic contents and the libraries' historical archives lived in a monolithic repository system &mdash; this was a <em>major source of growing pain when it comes to content discovery and usability</em>, and the situation only worsened as more contents were added into the repository.</p>

			<p>Thus came <strong>"The Great Migration"</strong> initiative. The plan was to...</p>

			<p><em>Migrate the academic contents to a new open source system</em>, let it inherit the Carolina Digital Repository name (CDR 2.0), and develop new and urgently needed features on top of it.</p>

			<p>Rename the legacy platform to Digital Collections Repository (DCR). Without having to devise workarounds, this would <em>allow the old platform be optimized for easier maintenance</em> in the long run.</p>

			<p>The main goals were to:</p>
			<ul >
				<li>Untangle parts that confuse users of academic vs library contents</li>
				<li>Introduce a modern system that makes feature development more doable</li>
				<li>Improve information architecture to allow for better content organization</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Through achieving these goals, our hope was that the migration would bring significant UX and productivity improvements to both platforms overall.</p>

			<p>As I have front-end skills myself, I also supported the developers in some of the code and quality assurance work.</p>

				By the Communities, For the Communities

			<p>Before the split, it was harder to pinpoint which group of users were using the platform for what purposes; the team had a limited knowledge of their goals, needs, and challenges.</p>

			<p><em>To make sure that we better understand our demographics</em>, I consolidated my own research with community insights and defined these personas.</p>

				<span>VALIDATION</span>
				A Task-Oriented Usability Test of CDR 2.0
			</h2>

			<p>As the new platform came with a prebuilt UI made by the open source community, we mainly focused on making adjustments and tweaking features to better fit our use cases. To better understand how the changes we introduced impacted the UX, I designed a formal lab test as a part of my research thesis &mdash; <a href="https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/concern/masters_papers/5x21tm05m" target="_blank"> the full paper can be found here</a>.</p>

			</div>

			<p>This was done with the alpha release of the new CDR 2.0 platform. The findings were subsequently used to introduce specific workflow improvements to better prepare for the public launch.</p>


			<p>Here are some noteworthy observations from the usability test:</p>

			<blockquote>"It must be somewhere but I guess I just didn’t see it." <br> The most severe instance of self-blame ... was due to the participant's perceived inability to complete the task.</blockquote>

			<blockquote>"What's the difference between keyword and subject?" <br> Even after reading the form label instruction, most participants could not clearly explain the reasoning of having two fields that serve a similar purpose.</blockquote>

				A New UI for the Legacy Platform

				A Better Access Control System
			</h2>
			<p>At one point, our lead developer suggested to me that the UX for the admin interface could also be further improved &mdash; it dawned on me that we've been focusing so much on the public side of things that we neglected the needs of our colleagues who use the system most frequently.</p>

			<p>After some back and forth discussions, we came up with two universal rules for the new system logic:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><em>Objects will inherit the access or viewing controls from the previous level</em> if the controls are the same or more restrictive.</li>
				<li><em>Accessing and viewing the objects are different layers</em>; users can still read the description and see the metadata, or see a low quality copy, even if they can’t access all the content.</li>
